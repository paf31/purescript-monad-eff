# DEPRECATED

The `Control.Monad.Eff.Class` module has been moved into `purescript-eff`. If you are using version 0.7 or later of the PureScript compiler, you should use `purescript-eff`. The [original v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-monad-eff/tree/v0.1.0) of this library will continue to work with older versions of the compiler.
